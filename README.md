# Support_Vector_Machine_Usage

In this repository, I am using Support Vector Machine for a small dataset given in the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication

In this firstly I am training two separate mmodels one on the original data and the other on the scaled data and then plotting their decision boundaries

Next I am plotting decision boundaries for only scaled data with different kernels and then plotting the decision boundaries for scaled data with rbf kernel but with different gamma and c values
